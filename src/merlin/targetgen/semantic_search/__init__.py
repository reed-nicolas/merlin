"""Bounded semantic instruction selection and scratchpad allocation.

``search`` compares exact captured linalg semantics with selected instruction
semantics. It enumerates equivalent instruction choices, including a small
sound integer commutativity rewrite, and retries allocation with Z3. The
returned plan is diagnostic until a target compiler emits and executes it.
