"""Resolve a ``(model, variant)`` to its capture bundle — the shared input every baseline ingests.

Each baseline framework starts from the SAME captured bundle under
``artifacts/recaptures/<model>_<variant>_consistent/`` so the comparison is apples-to-apples:

  * ``model.mlir``            — linalg-on-tensors export (Buddy/TVM-via-relax can ingest directly)
  * ``weights.safetensors``   (+ ``.manifest.json``)  — HF weights + arg-index map
  * ``inputs.npz`` / ``input_order.json`` — the seeded inputs
  * ``golden.npy``            — the torch reference output for correctness gating
  * ``extra.npz``             — registered buffers + lifted constants

The original PyTorch loader (for frameworks that ingest torch, e.g. ExecuTorch export / TVM
from_pytorch) lives OUTSIDE this repo at
``$MERLIN_MODEL2MLIR/workloads/<model>/loader.py`` (default ``/path/to/model2MLIR``).
