# Iteration workloads and headline validation

Use the same independent iteration models across accelerator examples. They are
small enough for capture, compiler development and numerical debugging without
loading a headline checkpoint. The capture worker seeds model construction.

| Iteration loader | Comparable operator patterns | Not established by passing it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Residual CNN](residual_cnn/loader.py) | Convolution, residual add, ReLU, spatial reduction, classifier | ResNet50 depth, BatchNorm folding, ImageNet accuracy or full-model coverage |
| [Causal decoder](causal_decoder/loader.py) | Embedding, RMSNorm, causal multi-head attention, gated MLP, logits | TinyLlama weights, rotary embeddings, KV-cache decoding or session coverage |
| [Multimodal policy](multimodal_policy/loader.py) | Vision patches, text/state inputs, concatenation, normalization, cross-attention, action output | SmolVLA architecture, checkpoint, denoising trajectory or policy accuracy |
| [Mixed MLP](coverage_mlp/loader.py) | Linear, activation and normalization seams | Any headline model or target support |

These models are independently authored patterns, **not extracted validation
subgraphs** and not architectural or numerical equivalents of the headline models.
Their smaller shapes are deliberate. Inspect exact frontend and MLIR signatures,
layouts, storage/compute/accumulator precision and transfer obligations before
making a property-specific comparison. A matching operator name alone is insufficient.

The held-out headline roster is **TinyLlama, SmolVLA and ResNet50**, declared through
the existing claim-model policy and each target's `workload_spec.models`. Do not
feed their captures, layer frequencies or results into capsule derivation or
performance selection. Independent model-scale derivation sources remain under
`workload_spec.applications`. Changing the roster requires fresh Phase 0 evidence
and corpora; saved runs retain their original inputs.

## Capture and inspect

Run the existing worker using an isolated model2MLIR interpreter with frontend
tracing enabled by its public API. No target code is needed in these loaders:

```bash
"$CAPTURE_PYTHON" src/merlin/targetgen/_m2m_capture_worker.py \
  --m2m-dir "$MODEL2MLIR_ROOT" \
  --loader examples/workloads/causal_decoder/loader.py \
  --dtype fp32 --seed 0 --materialize-bundle \
  --out out/artifacts/workloads/iteration/causal-decoder/fp32
```

The worker generates `frontend-trace.json`, `pytorch-opset.json`, `linalg.mlir`,
and a complete `model.mlir` bundle with external `weights.safetensors`,
inputs/goldens and a byte-bound `capture_receipt.json`. It reuses the exact
conversion/model instance, rather than recapturing a second model. Python,
NumPy and Torch are seeded before loader import, and deterministic algorithms
are required for the selected framework build. Repeat with the other loaders.
Inspect original, quantized and prepared static call counts and their exact
MLIR correspondence. An unsupported capture is a reported gap, not a reason to
silently substitute another operator or precision. Quantized runs require a
reviewed operation-scoped software/quantization spec, not a blanket model cast.

`application_demand_inventory(..., application_metadata={...})` accepts
explicit `workload_id`, `workload_role: iteration` and
`coverage_scope: full_capture` for these small models. Here `full_capture` means
the **small iteration model**, never its comparable headline workload. The
accounting report preserves these labels without turning them into support claims.

## Full validation

Use the existing model2MLIR loaders for the real headline checkpoints. Record
checkpoint revision, frontend/runtime versions, representative input source and
preprocessing, precision policy and execution scope. Random-weight or truncated
TinyLlama, random-input ResNet50 and a single SmolVLA denoising step are explicitly
scoped diagnostics, not complete headline validation. SmolVLA's session workflow
and TinyLlama's prefill/decode workflow need their own interfaces and checks.

[Headline capture and lowering](headline_validation/README.md) gives reproducible
commands for all three models, names each scope, and shows where to inspect the
separate MLIR, tensor payload, session contract and lowering-stage artifacts.

Phase 0 audits declarations and capsule obligations. Phase 1 must prove complete
lowering, execution and numerical agreement; Phase 2 measures performance on a
separate cohort. Report accelerator, host and unsupported work independently and
never count host-only execution as successful accelerator coverage.

See [the Phase 0 specification guide](../../docs/guides/phase0_specification.md)
for the generated evidence layout and admission requirements.
